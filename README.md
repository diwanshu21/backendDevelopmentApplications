# ToDo App

The ToDo App is a simple application that allows users to manage their tasks and to-do items. Users can create, update, and delete tasks, as well as view a list of all tasks they have.

## Features

- Create tasks with title, description, and due date.
- Update existing tasks' details.
- Delete tasks you no longer need.
- View a list of all tasks.

## Components

- **API**: The backend provides API endpoints for task management. These endpoints include `create`, `update`, `delete`, and `getalltasks`.

- **Frontend**: The frontend interface is built using JavaScript and provides an intuitive way for users to interact with their tasks.

## Workflow

1. User interacts with the frontend to manage tasks.
2. Frontend sends API requests to backend for task management.
3. Backend processes requests and interacts with the database.
4. Backend responds to frontend with success messages or data.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js (Express.js) with MongoDB for data storage.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` for both frontend and backend.
3. Start the backend server using `npm start` in the backend directory.
4. Open `index.html` in your browser to use the ToDo App.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/create`: Create a new task.
- `POST /api/update`: Update an existing task.
- `DELETE /api/delete`: Delete a task.
- `GET /api/tasks`: Retrieve all tasks.

## Further Improvements

Here are some ideas for further improving the ToDo App:

- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to ensure that each user's tasks are private and secure.
- 
- **Task Categories or Tags**: Allow users to categorize tasks with tags or assign them to specific categories.

- **Task Filtering and Sorting**: Provide options to filter tasks based on criteria like due date, completion status, etc.

- **Task Archive**: Add an option to archive completed or older tasks to keep the task list clean.
